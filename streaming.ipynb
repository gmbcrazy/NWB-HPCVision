    "You can read specific sections within individual data files directly from remote stores such as the\n",
    "[DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org/). This is especially useful for reading small pieces of data\n",
    "from a large NWB file stored\n",
    "remotely. First, you will need to get the location of the file. The code below illustrates how to do this on DANDI\n",
    "using the dandi API library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the location of the file on DANDI\n",
    "\n",
    "The :py:class:`~dandi.dandiapi.DandiAPIClient` can be used to get the S3 URL of any NWB file stored in the DANDI\n",
    "Archive. If you have not already, install the latest release of the ``dandi`` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install dandi\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can get the url of a particular NWB file using the dandiset ID and the path of that file within the dandiset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient\n",
    "\n",
    "dandiset_id = '000006'  # ephys dataset from the Svoboda Lab\n",
    "filepath = 'sub-anm372795/sub-anm372795_ses-20170718.nwb'  # 450 kB file\n",

    "## Streaming Method 1: ROS3\n",
    "ROS3 is one of the supported methods for reading data from a remote store. ROS3 stands for \"read only S3\" and is a\n",
    "driver created by the HDF5 Group that allows HDF5 to read HDF5 files stored remotely in s3 buckets. Using this method\n",
    "requires that your HDF5 library is installed with the ROS3 driver enabled. This is not the default configuration,\n",
    "so you will need to make sure you install the right version of ``h5py`` that has this advanced configuration enabled.\n",
    "You can install HDF5 with the ROS3 driver from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) using ``conda``. You may\n",
    "first need to uninstall a currently installed version of ``h5py``.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall h5py\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge \"h5py>=3.2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now instantiate a :py:class:`~pynwb.NWBHDF5IO` object with the S3 URL and specify the driver as \"ros3\". This\n",
    "will download metadata about the file from the S3 bucket to memory. The values of datasets are accessed lazily,\n",
    "just like when reading an NWB file stored locally. So, slicing into a dataset will require additional time to\n",
    "download the sliced data (and only the sliced data) to memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pynwb import NWBHDF5IO\n",
    "\n",
    "with NWBHDF5IO(s3_url, mode='r', load_namespaces=True, driver='ros3') as io:\n",
    "    nwbfile = io.read()\n",
    "    print(nwbfile)\n",
    "    print(nwbfile.acquisition['lick_times'].time_series['lick_left_times'].data[:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Streaming Method 2: fsspec\n",
    "fsspec is another data streaming approach that is quite flexible and has several performance advantages. This library\n",
    "creates a virtual filesystem for remote stores. With this approach, a virtual file is created for the file and\n",
    "the virtual filesystem layer takes care of requesting data from the S3 bucket whenever data is\n",
    "read from the virtual file.  Note that this implementation is completely unaware of internals of the HDF5 format\n",
    "and thus can work for **any** file, not only for the purpose of use with H5PY and PyNWB.\n",
    "\n",
    "First install ``fsspec`` and the dependencies of the :py:class:`~fsspec.implementations.http.HTTPFileSystem`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fsspec requests aiohttp\n",

    "import fsspec\n",
    "import pynwb\n",
    "import h5py\n",
    "from fsspec.implementations.cached import CachingFileSystem\n",
    "\n",
    "# first, create a virtual filesystem based on the http protocol and use\n",
    "# caching to save accessed data to RAM.\n",
    "fs = CachingFileSystem(\n",
    "    fs=fsspec.filesystem(\"http\"),\n",
    "    cache_storage=\"nwb-cache\",  # Local folder for the cache\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# next, open the file\n",
    "with fs.open(s3_url, \"rb\") as f:\n",
    "    with h5py.File(f) as file:\n",

    "            print(nwbfile.acquisition['lick_times'].time_series['lick_left_times'].data[:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "fsspec is a library that can be used to access a variety of different store formats, including (at the time of\n",
